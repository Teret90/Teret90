## About Me

I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how data can shape the world around us. With a background in **Sociology** and **Forestry Management**, I developed a deep curiosity for understanding complex systems and their impact on both people and the environment. My journey into data science truly began during my time at a startup in Soria, where I worked closely with experts building advanced **machine learning models** to provide accurate agricultural predictions. While my role focused on **gathering and analyzing data**, their passion and expertise sparked my own interest in diving deeper into this incredible field. Now, I‚Äôm driven to apply these tools to create meaningful, data-driven solutions that can make a real difference in today‚Äôs world.
