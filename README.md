## üìù Featured Projects

### [Exploratory Data Analysis on Social Media Impact on Mental Health](https://github.com/Teret90/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Social-Media-Impact-on-Mental-Health)

<!--<img src="./images/pexels-slaytinaaaa-4619829.jpg" alt="MentalHealth" width="150"/>-->

**Objective:** Analyze the relationship between social media usage and mental health using statistical techniques.

- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

- **Key Achievements:**
  - **Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified key patterns in survey data related to social media usage and mental health risks.
  - **Identified High-Risk Behavior:** Found that social media use beyond two hours daily is associated with higher mental health risks.
  - **Actionable Insights:** Applied statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights and trends, providing data-driven recommendations for mental health interventions.

#### Research Impact

This analysis underscores the growing importance of understanding the effects of social media on mental health. The project provides insights that can inform policymakers, mental health professionals, and the public about potential risks associated with excessive social media use.


### [Hominid Classification Model with Streamlit Integration](https://github.com/Teret90/Hominid-Classification-Model-with-Streamlit-Integration)

<!--<img src="./images/Captura de pantalla 2024-04-25 003524.png" alt="Hominidos" width="300"/>-->

**Objective:** Demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of machine learning models by developing a classification system for hominid species. This project highlights how machine learning can be applied to diverse fields of research beyond traditional business applications.

- **Technologies:**Python,Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit


- **Key Achievements**
  - **Explored Multiple Classification Algorithms:** Compared the performance of various classification models, including **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, to determine their suitability for hominid classification.
  - **Optimized Model Selection:** Identified **Random Forest** as the most effective model due to its superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and ability to handle complex datasets.
  - **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring a robust and reliable classification system.
  - **Interactive Deployment:** Developed a user-friendly interface using **Streamlit**, allowing for real-time interaction with the model and providing an accessible platform for users to classify hominid species.

#### Research Impact

This project not only illustrates the potential of machine learning in classification tasks but also underscores its relevance in scientific research. By applying advanced algorithms to hominid classification, the project demonstrates how machine learning can facilitate deeper insights and contribute to various research domains, including anthropology and evolutionary studies.

### [Generative AI Recipe Recommender](https://github.com/Teret90/LLM_Docker)
**Objective:** Develop a web application that recommends recipes based on user-provided ingredients using generative AI models.

- **Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, OpenAI API, PostgreSQL, Docker, asyncpg
- **Key Features:**
  - **Recipe Recommendation:** Users input available ingredients, and the app connects to generative AI models (via OpenAI) to suggest recipes.
  - **Interaction History:** Users can save their ingredient inputs and the AI-generated recipe suggestions in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Render.
  - **History Lookup:** Users can view a history of their past interactions, including all queries and recommended recipes.
- **Deployment:** The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment. Users can pull the Docker image and run it locally or via Docker Desktop.
